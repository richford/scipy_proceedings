        Microenvironment",
    author    = "Nance, Elizabeth",
    abstract  = "The past decade has witnessed explosive growth in the
        development of nanoparticle-based therapies for the treatment of
        neurological disorders and diseases. The systemic delivery of
        therapeutic carriers to the central nervous system (CNS) is
        hindered by both the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the porous
        and electrostatically charged brain extracellular matrix (ECM),
        which acts as a steric and adhesive barrier. Therapeutic
        delivery to the brain is influenced by changes in the brain
        microenvironment, which can occur as a function of physiology,
        biology, pathology, and developmental age. Brain-penetrating
        nanoparticles (BPNs) are an optimal platform not only for
        therapeutic delivery to the brain, but also for evaluating
        changes in the brain microenvironment. BPNs possess both the
        capability to readily move within their local environment to
        survey their surroundings and the ability to reach the diffuse
        disease cells often associated with CNS disorders. To achieve
        effective delivery of BPNs to specific locations within the
        brain requires careful control over the nanoparticle's transport
        properties. Here, we describe the process of conjugating a dense
        layer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to the surface of
        nonbiodegradable nanoparticles to achieve brain-penetrating
        capabilities.",

    abstract  = "We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the
        automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of
        single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution
        that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and
        intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and
        adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time,
        3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants.
        TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that
        aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of
        TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily
        customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an
        extensible platform where developers can easily write their own
        detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis
        algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving
        framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly
        develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate
        modules without the need of having to write de novo user
        interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting
        tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in
        the context of three different biological problems. First, we
        perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how
        light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early
        development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the
        lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we
        investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential
        modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the
        cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts
        in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse
        motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for
        quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis
        in plant cells.",
